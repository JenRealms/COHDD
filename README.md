powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or using pip
pip install uv
```

### 2. Clone and Setup Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd COHDD

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env-example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
# Required variables:
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
# - AWS_Model_ID
# - OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
# - TAVILY_API_KEY
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Launch the Web Interface

```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Launch the ADK web interface
adk web
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in your configuration).

## ü§ñ AI Agents Overview

### COH Agent - Main Coordinator

The **COH Agent** is your primary interface for conducting comprehensive COH analysis. It coordinates multiple specialized agents to provide complete insights.

#### Key Features:
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrates weather, RCA, web search, data collection, and visualization agents
- **Intelligent Workflow Planning**: Automatically detects user intent and creates step-by-step analysis plans
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Integrates weather data, station information, and operational context
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Combines multiple data sources for complete insights

#### Capabilities:
- Root Cause Attribution (RCA) analysis
- Weather impact assessment
- Station location and regional analysis
- Data collection and visualization
- File management and report generation

### DD Writer Agent - Deep Dive Reports

The **DD Writer Agent** specializes in creating comprehensive Deep Dive (DD) reports by analyzing multiple COH factors in parallel.

#### Key Features:
- **Parallel Analysis**: Runs 10 specialized analysis agents simultaneously
- **Multi-Factor Investigation**: Analyzes backlog, capacity changes, demand signals, exclusions, flex operations, mechanical issues, and weather impacts
- **Professional Report Generation**: Synthesizes findings into actionable insights
- **Data Visualization**: Creates charts and graphs to support analysis

#### Analysis Areas:
1. **Backlog Impact Analysis**: Evaluates backlog management effectiveness
2. **Capacity Change Analysis**: Assesses capacity planning and adjustments
3. **Demand Signal Analysis**: Examines demand forecasting accuracy
4. **Exclusions Impact**: Analyzes exclusion policies and effects
5. **Flex Operations**: Evaluates UTR/OTR flex-up capabilities
6. **Mechanical Issues**: Identifies equipment-related constraints
7. **Weather Impact**: Assesses environmental factors
8. **Root Cause Attribution**: Provides primary constraint identification

## üí° Use Case Examples

### COH Agent Use Cases

#### 1. Create COH Distribution Map for Today
```
"Create a map showing COH distribution across all US stations for today"
```
**What it does:**
- Collects current COH data for all stations
- Creates an interactive geographic visualization
- Shows COH hotspots and regional patterns
- Provides station-level detail on hover

#### 2. Root Cause Attribution for Specific Station
```
"Analyze the root cause attribution of COH for station DML6 on 2025-08-13"
```
**What it does:**
- Conducts comprehensive RCA analysis
- Integrates weather data for context
- Identifies primary constraints and contributing factors
- Provides actionable recommendations

#### 3. Weather Impact Assessment
```
"Assess weather impact on station DHI2 operations for 2025-02-14"
```
**What it does:**
- Retrieves historical weather data
- Analyzes weather-related capacity changes
- Correlates weather events with COH patterns
- Provides weather mitigation strategies

### DD Writer Agent Use Cases

#### 1. Comprehensive Deep Dive Report
```
"Create a deep dive report for station DGE4 on 2025-08-05"
```
**What it does:**
- Runs parallel analysis across all 10 factors
- Collects comprehensive data for the 30-day period
- Generates professional report with executive summary
- Includes data visualizations and recommendations
- Saves report in both Markdown and HTML formats

#### 2. Multi-Station Comparative Analysis
```
"Generate deep dive analysis comparing stations DBM3, DML6, and DNA6 for 2025-08-13"
```
