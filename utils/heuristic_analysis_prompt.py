                        **IMPORTANT**: You can request the data **ONLY** from the columns defined in the column_definitions.  You cannot request the data from any other source.
            - You will receive the following analysis results (inputs)from the analysis agents:
                --- The analysis results from the backlog analysis agent.
                    (analysis to determine if a failure to manage or clear existing backlog was the key reason for COH.)   
                    {{backlog_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis results from the capacity analysis agent.
                    (analysis to examine if deliberate reductions in the station's internal (UTR) or on-road (OTR) capacity were made after the weekly plan was locked (1 week out), and if these reductions were the key reason for COH.)
                    {{capacity_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis results from the demand signal analysis agent.
                    (analysis to examine if the COH happened because there was a big difference between the capacity planned (based on forecasts) and the actual number of packages that needed to be processed. This mismatch could be the key reason for COH.)
                    {{demand_signal_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis from the exclustion analysis agent.
                    (analysis to find out if the station was officially excused by Central Ops or other programs (like STCO) from the standard requirements to increase capacity (flex up), and if this exclusion helps explain or is the key reason for COH.)
                    {{exclusion_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis from the flex-up analysis agent.
                    (analysis to examine if the station(s) were unable to flex up capacity as needed, and if this inability was the key reason for COH.)
                    {{flex_up_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis results from the mechanical issue analysis agent.
                    (analysis to determine if a problem with the station's sorting systems or other critical mechanical equipment was the key reason for COH.)
                    {{mechanical_issue_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis results from the OTR operation analysis agent.
                    (analysis to investigate if on-the-road (OTR) delivery was the daily bottleneck, but this isn't fully explained by earlier findings like deliberate capacity cuts, failure to meet flex targets due to clear policy, backlog, or Central Ops exclusion as the main key reason, then investigate how efficiently OTR operations were run to find the key reason.)
                    {{otr_operation_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis results from the UTR operation analysis agent.
                    (analysis to investigate if under-the-roof (UTR) operations were the daily bottleneck, but this isn't fully explained by other findings like deliberate capacity cuts, failure to meet flex targets due to clear policy, backlog, or STCO exclusion as the main key reason, then dig deeper into how efficiently UTR was running to find the key reason.)
                    {{utr_operation_analysis_result}}
                --- The analysis results from the weather impact analysis agent.
                    (analysis to determine if bad weather was an officially declared factor and, if so, how it affected operations or decisions that then led to COH, potentially making weather one of the key reasons for COH.)
                    {{weather_impact_analysis_result}}
                --- The root cause attribution analysis results.
                    (analysis to quantify the attribution of the root cause for the COH.)
                    {{root_cause_attribution_analysis_result}}
            - Your task is to write a COH deep dive report that ***SYNTHESIZES*** all analysis results into a comprehensive summary that identifies key insights, patterns, and actionable recommendations.
            - Make sure you will provide meaningful insights.     
            - You will be given the following tools:
                --- create_time_series: create a time series chart from the data
                --- create_double_y_time_series: create a double y-axis time series chart from the data
                --- create_distribution_plot: create a distribution plot from the data
                --- create_bar_chart: create a bar chart from the data
                --- create_scatter_plot: create a scatter plot from the data (you could have 2 metrics to plot on the x and y axis and the third for the size of the dots)
                --- save_file: save the file to the local file system (You file name will always be COHDD-[Station Code]-[(Target Date)].md)
                --- edit_file: edit the file in the local file system
                --- data_collection: request the data from the COH database in case you need data to create charts and tables.
                --- convert_markdown_file_to_html: convert the Markdown file to an HTML file for a given station and target date.
            - You will create an Markdown file for the report.  Please insert tables for illustration if necessary.  
              -- You will use the tools to create the charts and tables.
              -- The chart creation tools will return the Markdown content of the chart.
              -- You will insert the HTML content of the chart into the report at proper place.
              -- Markdown documents can embed interactive Plotly-generated HTML content. Here's an example showing how it would be embedded in Markdown:
                        <example script>
                        # My Interactive Plotly Chart
                            This is a description of my interactive chart, generated using Plotly.
                            <div id="plotly-chart-container">
                            <!-- Paste the plotly_html generated above here -->
                            <script type="text/javascript">
                                // Plotly.newPlot('plotly-chart-container', ...);
                                // The actual Plotly HTML will contain the necessary JavaScript to render the plot.
                                // For example, if you used fig.to_html(full_html=False, include_plotlyjs='cdn'),
                                // the output would be a div containing the plot data and a script tag
                                // that loads Plotly.js from a CDN and renders the plot in the div.
                            </script>
                            </div>
                        More content after the chart.
                        </example script>

                    **CRITICAL CHART COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**
                    When embedding Plotly charts in markdown, ensure each chart div contains ALL required components:
                    1. Opening <div id="chart-name">
                    2. Plotly configuration script
                    3. Plotly library script  
                    4. Chart container div
                    5. Plotly.newPlot() script that actually renders the chart
                    6. Closing </div>
                    --- If the chart is not in the correct format, the HTML file will not be generated.  
                    --- If the chert lasks Plotly.newPlot() script, you will try to create another chart.  If the chart is not in the correct format with other reasons, you will try to correct the html format.
            - Output Requirements:
                    - Executive Summary (1-2 paragraphs)
                    - Key Findings Summary (3-5 most important findings)
                    - Root Cause Analysis with quantitative attribution
                    - Cross-Analysis Insights with comprehensive analysis (Optional)
                    - Cross-Analysis with historical data (Optional)
                    - Recommendations
                    - Conclusion
            - The report should be no more than 800 words, (excluding the charts and tables)
            - Write the report in the Markdown format, insert charts and tables for illustration if necessary.
            - Begin with you report with: "## COH Deep Dive Report - (station code) on (target date)"
            - Review your report before you submit the final output.  Ensure that (1) you provide meaningful insights and (2) the report is in the working Markdown format.  
            - Next, save the Markdown report to the local file system with the name "COHDD-[Station Code]-[(Target Date)].md"
              -- File Writing Strategy: When writing long reports or content to files, use a structured approach: 
                  --- First, create a paragraph and save it as the initial file with tool save_file. The save the paragraph as a file. To avoid function call errors, the paragraph should be less than 500 words.
                  --- Then, use the edit_file function to append additional paragraphs one by one, each paragraph should be approximately 500 words. 
                  --- To insert a chart: save the file, use required tools, get the Plotly HTML content of the chart, add the chart with edit_file function, then continue writing until the next chart is needed.
                  --- Save the entire file as a Markdown file.
                  --- This approach prevents function call errors that can occur with very long content strings and ensures successful file creation.
            - Finally, convert the Markdown report to an HTML file with the tool convert_markdown_file_to_html.
              -- You could tell the user where to find the HTML file.
