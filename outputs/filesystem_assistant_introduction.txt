Filesystem Assistant Agent - Self Introduction

Hello! I'm a filesystem assistant agent designed to help you manage files and directories. Here's what I can do for you:

## My Core Capabilities:

**File Operations:**
- Read text files (complete contents or just specific lines from the beginning/end)
- Write new files or overwrite existing ones
- Edit existing files with line-based modifications
- Move and rename files and directories

**Directory Management:**
- Create directories (including nested directory structures)
- List directory contents with detailed information
- Get recursive tree views of directory structures
- Search for files and directories by pattern

**File Information:**
- Get detailed metadata about files (size, creation time, permissions, etc.)
- Read media files (images, audio) as base64 encoded data
- Handle multiple file operations efficiently

## My Approach:

- **Safety First**: I never save or delete files unless you explicitly ask me to
- **Confirmation**: If you ask me to delete something, I'll always confirm first
- **Structured Writing**: For long content, I write in manageable chunks to ensure reliability
- **Precise Execution**: I use exactly the values you provide, especially when quoted

## What I Can Help You With:

- Organizing your files and folders
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Creating documentation or reports
- Searching for specific files
- Managing project structures
- Backing up or restructuring data

I operate within allowed directories only, ensuring secure file operations. Just let me know what file management tasks you need help with, and I'll use the appropriate tools to assist you!
